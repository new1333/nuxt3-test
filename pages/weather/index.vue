      You have reached the landing page of the Logoipsum company. Now, let's get
      started!
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-4xl pb-4">
      The manager of the company thinks that the website homepage is boring.
      Because he likes golfing in his free time, the designer has suggested
      connecting the frontend to a weather API and pull the current weather from
      an API and to display current general weather condition and temperature on
      the website (the company is located in Basel, Switzerland).
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-4xl pb-4">
      A colleague from the IT department has already kindly prepared the API
      configuration in the store module of the web application. However, he did
      not have time to finish the work before holiday. You are now asked to
      complete the colleague's task. In particular, the store action needs to be
      finished and called, data committed to the application state and bind the
      state to the UI. As for displaying the current weather conditions in the
      UI, the designer has not given any particular instructions (you are free
      to design it). However, he thought that it would be nice to have an icon
      to depict the current weather condition.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-4xl pb-4">
      The company's Software Architect has given three key advices: he wants to
      keep the application modular and thus work with components. He also
      insists on using proper state management with Vuex. As for styling the
      application, we should use tailwindCSS as much as possible so that we can
      update the corporate design system anytime.

          Store the weather data into a cookie to reduce initial page load time
